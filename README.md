## Introduction
This connector is developed for Inbenta’s customers to be able to have their users chat with the chatbot through WhatsApp as a channel. 360 Dialog is a verified WhatsApp Business Solution (BSP) and provides direct access to WhatsApp Business API.

## Features
Following are the features supported by this connector:

* FAQ Intents with images, videos and Hyperlinks as external links.
* Related Contents.
* Sidebubble Text (Will be appended to the Answer Text when displayed).
* Multiple options.
* Polar Questions.
* Dialogs.
* Forms, Actions & Variables (with text transformations where applicable).
* Hyperchat escalation after X no-results answers (configuration in chat.php).
* Hyperchat escalation from any content.
* Translation labels (can be set up in ‘Extra Info’ section of backstage).

>**NOTE 1:** The use of buttons is limited to a maximum of **3** buttons with a length of **20** characters for each button title, consider this when creating intents (**Multiple options**, **List Values**, etc).

>**NOTE 2:** In case you have a content with more than 3 buttons, **360 Connector** will automatically transform it into **Interactive List Messages**. This type of message will display all the options (up to 10) inside a _List Menu_ (this "window" will be displayed after the touch / click of a button).

## Configuration
### Inbenta Instance
**Create translations object in ExtraInfo (optional)**

You can manage the translation labels from Extra Info. Here are the steps to create the translations object:

1. In your Backstage instance, go to Knowledge → Extra Info and click on 'Manage groups and types' → 360dialog→ Add type. Name it '**translations**' and add a new property with type 'Multiple' named with your chatbot's language label (en, es, it...).
2. Inside the language object, add all the labels that you want to override. Each label should be a 'text' type entry (you can find the labels list below).
3. Save your translations object.

Now you can create the ExtraInfo object by clicking the **New entry** button, selecting the 'translations' type and naming it as 'translations'. Then, fill each label with your desired translation and remember to publish ExtraInfo by clicking the **Post** button.

Here you have the current labels with their English value:
* **agent_joined** => 'Agent $agentName has joined the conversation.',
* **api_timeout** => 'Please, reformulate your question.',
* **ask_rating_comment** => 'Please tell us why',
* **ask_to_escalate** => 'Do you want to start a chat with a human agent?',
* **chat_closed** => 'Chat closed',
* **creating_chat** => 'I will try to connect you with an agent. Please wait.',
* **error_creating_chat** => 'There was an error joining the chat',
* **escalation_rejected** => 'What else can I do for you?',
* **no** => 'No',
* **no_agents** => 'No agents available',
* **queue_estimation_first** => 'There is one person ahead of you.',
* **queue_estimation** => 'There are $queuePosition people ahead of you.',
* **rate_content_intro** => 'Was this answer helpful?',
* **thanks** => 'Thanks!',
* **yes** => 'Yes',
* **close_chat_key_word** => '/close',
* **out_of_time** => '_There are no agents connected_',
* **queue_warning** => 'Wait until an agent is connected before making a question.',
* **no_rating_given** => 'We understand you do not want to rate.'

>**Note**
Remember to publish your ExtraInfo changes by clicking the ‘Post’ button.
Even if you have created the ExtraInfo translation, it is mandatory that the lang file exists in the “lang” folder.

**HyperChat integration (optional)**

If you want to use HyperChat you must subscribe your UI to the Hyperchat events. Open your _Messenger_ instance. Go to Messenger → Settings → HyperChat → Webhooks. 

Here, in the ‘Events’ column type “queues:update,invitations:new,invitations:accept,forever:alone,chats:close, messages:new,users:activity”. In the ‘Target’ column paste your UI’s URL, then click on the ‘+’ button on the right.

Make sure to select the accepted files for **file sharing** (allowed both end-users and agents). Go to Messenger → Settings → HyperChat → Conversation, and add one of the following (if is not in the list): jpeg, png, pdf, xls, xlsx, doc, docx, mp4, avi, mp3, mpeg, ogg.

> Voice format for Whatsapp is **OGG audio** (.oga), make sure to be selected if you want to use it in the escalation.

### WhatsApp Business Account
Before a business can access the WhatsApp Business API, each client has to go through an approval procedure.
The following information is required for opening a WhatsApp Business Account (WABA):

* Facebook Manager ID
* Phone number with the ability to receive either voice or SMS
* Business Name & Display Name
* Company logo (square JPG, min 300x300 px)
* Company description (max. 130 characters)
* Postal address of the company where utility bills go to
* Contact email where customers can reach the business
* URL (end-point) to which incoming WhatsApp messages will be forwarded (typically provided by a 360dialog partner)

You can find more information on their page - https://docs.360dialog.com/api/onboarding-guide-summary

Additional Documentation - [360 Dialog Documentation](https://docs.360dialog.com)

### Sandbox Environment

The Sandbox environment can be instanced without a Whatsapp Business Account. You can start testing by sending a Whatsapp message to ```491606232334``` (Note: current number at the time of this documentation. Could be different now. Please check the 360 dialog documentation.) with the word ```START```, the response for this request is the sandbox ```API KEY```. The next step is to set the Webhook.

For sandbox, there is no limit of messages, but only text-based messages can be sent/received (media files are not supported). More information: https://docs.360dialog.com/api/whatsapp-api/sandbox

### Add the Api Key and URLs to Chatbot 360 Dialog Template

In **conf/custom/360.php** file, you have to add 4 values:

* **api_key:** Provided by 360 Dialog or by the Sandbox response (check previous step).
* **url_messages:** The URL where the messages to Whatsapp are delivered. Possible values, for production: https://waba.360dialog.io/v1/messages, for sandbox: https://waba-sandbox.messagepipe.io/v1/messages
* **url_subscribe:** URL used to set your webhook. Possible values, for production: https://waba.messagepipe.io/v1/configs/webhook, for sandbox: https://waba-sandbox.messagepipe.io/v1/configs/webhook
* **url_webhook:** This is the URL where your app is hosted. Is used to link your Whatsapp phone number to your app server.
```php
return [
    'api_key' => '',
    'url_messages' => '',
    'url_subscribe' => '',
    'url_webhook' => ''
];
```

### Setting the Webhook

Whatsapp needs a defined webhook to interact with the Inbenta Chatbot. This webhook is the URL of the Inbenta Chatbot 360 dialog connector application (```url_of_your_deployed_app```). You need to execute (from Postman or from a web browser), using GET method.

[```url_of_your_deployed_app```]?subscribe=1

Before execute the previous instruction, you need to validate that **conf/custom/360.php** file has the ```api_key```, ```url_subscribe``` and ```url_webhook``` properly filled.

### Setup Inbenta Chatbot 360 Dialog Connector Code

**Required Configuration**

It's pretty simple to get this UI working. The mandatory configuration files are included by default in ```/conf/custom``` to be filled in, so you have to provide the information required in these files:

* **File 'api.php'** Provide the API Key and API Secret of your Chatbot Instance.
* **File 'environments.php'** Here you can define regexes to detect ```development``` and ```preproduction``` environments. If the regexes do not match the current conditions or there isn't any regex configured, ```production``` environment will be assumed.
* **File ‘360.php’** Instructions mentioned in the previous section.

**Optional Configuration**

Some of the optional features that can be enabled from the configuration files too. Every optional configuration file should be copied from **/conf/default** to **/conf/custom**. The bot will detect the customization and it will load the right version. Here is a list of those optional configuration files:

**HYPERCHAT (chat.php)**

* **chat**
    * **enabled:** Enable or disable HyperChat (“**true**” or “**false**”).
    * **version:** HyperChat version. The default and latest one is 1.
    * **appId:** The ID of the HyperChat app. This defines the instance in which the chat opens. You can find it in your instance → Messenger → Settings → Chat.
    * **secret:** Your HyperChat instance application secret. You can find it in your instance → Messenger → Settings → Chat.
    * **roomId:** The room where the chat opens. This is mapped directly to a Backstage queue ID. Numeric value, not a string. You can find your rooms list it in your instance → Messenger → Settings → Queues.
    * **lang:** Language code (in ISO 639-1 format) for the current chat. This is used when the engine checks if there are agents available for this language to assign the chat to one of them.

        * **confirmToStart**: "**true**" to launch a message to confirm if the survey should start (or not). "**false**" to avoid the confirmation message.
* **triesBeforeEscalation:** Number of no-result answers in a row after the bot should escalate to an agent (if available). Numeric value, not a string. Zero means it’s disabled.
* **negativeRatingsBeforeEscalation:** Number of negative content ratings in a row after the bot should escalate to an agent (if available). Numeric value, not a string. Zero means it’s disabled.

**MESSENGER (api.php)**

In the same file of the Chatbot credentials (**api.php**), as optional values, you have **Messenger API** credentials (**key** and **secret**). This connection will allow to display Messenger Surveys (if properly configured) and the ability to get responses from closed tickets.

* **messenger:**
    * **key:** API Key of the Messenger Instance. You can find it in Administration → API → [Production | Development].
    * **secret:** Secret Key token of the Messenger Instance. You can find it in Administration → API → [Production | Development].
    * **webhook_secret:** Secret token, defined when the configuration of [External Ticket Source](https://help.inbenta.com/en/configuring-an-external-tickets-source/) is made. The intent of this value is to get messages from agent, after the ticket is closed.

**CONVERSATION (conversation.php)**

* **default:** Contains the API conversation configuration. The values are described below:
    * **answers:**
        * **sideBubbleAttributes:** Dynamic settings to show side-bubble content. Because there is no side-bubble in 360 Dialog the content is shown after the main answer.
        * **answerAttributes:** Dynamic settings to show as the bot answer. The default is [ "ANSWER_TEXT" ]. Setting multiple dynamic settings generates a bot answer with concatenated values with a newline character (\n).
        * **maxOptions:** Maximum number of options returned in a multiple-choice answer.
    * **forms:**
        * **allowUserToAbandonForm:** Whether or not a user is allowed to abandon the form after a number of consecutive failed answers. The default value is **true**.

* **user_type:** Profile identifier from the Backstage knowledge base. Minimum:0. Default:0. You can find your profile list in your Chatbot Instance → Settings → User Types.
* **source:** Source identifier (e.g. “360dialog”) used to filter the logs in the dashboards.
* **content_ratings:**
    * **enabled:** Enable or disable the rating feature (“***true***” or “***false***”).
    * **ratings:** Array of options to display in order to rate the content. Every option has the following parameters:
        * **id:** Id of your content rating. You can find your content ratings in your Chatbot instance → Settings → Ratings. Remember that your rating type should be "**content**".
        * **label:** Key of the label translation to display within the rating option button. The available labels can be configured from **/lang/**. Also can be modified from Backstage as described in section **Create translations object in ExtraInfo (optional)**.
        * **comment:** If **true**, asks for a comment for the rating. It's useful when a user rates a content negatively in order to ask why the negative rating.
        * **isNegative:** If **true**, the bot will increment the negative-comments counter in order to escalate with an agent (if HyperChat **negativeRatingsBeforeEscalation** is configured).
* **digester**
    * **active_buttons** Enable or disable the buttons for Multiple Choice Questions (“***true***” or “***false***”). If enabled, consider that Whatsapp only allows a length of 20 characters for the title of the buttons, if longer, the string will not be fully dislplayed. Even if it is not active, polar questions (Yes / No) will always be displayed with buttons.

**ENVIRONMENTS (environments.php)**

This file allows configuring a rule to detect the current environment for the connector. It can check the current **http_host** or the **script_name** in order to detect the environment.

* **development:**
    * **type:** Detection type: check the **http_host** (e.g. _www.example.com_) or the **script_name** (e.g. _/path/to/the/connector/server.php_).
    * **regex:** Regex to match with the detection type (e.g. “_/^dev.mydomain.com$/m_“ will set the “development” environment when the detection type is _dev.example.com_).
* **preproduction:**
    * **type:** Detection type: check the **http_host** (e.g. _www.example.com_) or the **script_name** (e.g. _/path/to/the/connector/server.php_). /path/to/the/connector/server.php).
    * **regex:** Regex to match with the detection type (e.g. “_/^.*/staging/.*$/m_“ will set the “preproduction” environment when the detection type is "_/staging/_").
    
**Deployment**

The 360 Dialog template must be served by a public web server in order to allow 360 Dialog to send the events to it. The environment where the template has been developed and tested has the following specifications

* Apache 2.4
* PHP 7.3
* PHP Curl extension
* Non-CPU-bound
* The latest version of [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) (Dependency Manager for PHP) to install all dependencies that Inbenta requires for the integration.
* If the client has a distributed infrastructure, this means that multiple servers can manage the user session, they must adapt their SessionHandler so that the entire session is shared among all its servers.

### Troubleshooting

**Missing HyperChat messages**

Check if your UI is subscribed to Hyperchat webhooks as described **HyperChat integration (optional)**. Also, check if the Hyperchat settings in the UI are valid in **conf/custom/chat.php**.

**The bot is not answering (webhook configuration)**

You can check the current webhook URL in your Whatsapp configuration. Also, check if the tokens in **conf/custom/api.php** (key and secret) are valid.

**The bot is not answering (application cache)**

If the previous tip doesn't work, maybe your application is caching older token values from extraInfo and you should delete the cached session files in your server. These files are stored in the configured system temporary path returned by the PHP function sys_get_temp_dir(). Usually, it’s “/tmp” or “/var/tmp” but may vary depending on your server system and configuration. When you locate the directory, remove all the files named like “cached-accesstoken-XXXX” and “cached-appdata-XXX”.
